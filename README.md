A Python Implementation of a Random Forest
==========================================

This repository contains a few python modules that can be used to make 
a random forest classifer. 

The random generator that is used for bagging and making the subset of features
uses a system set seed, or random resouce, each time meaning that the results
will vary from trial to trial. The results have the same general pattern 
but you will not very likely see the same exact stats twice.
